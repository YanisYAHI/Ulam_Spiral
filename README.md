# Ulam_Spiral

A collection of Processing sketches exploring the Ulam spiral, shapes and number-theory visualisations.

## 🧮 Project Overview  
This repository contains several `.pde` sketches (Processing files) that visualise mathematical patterns such as the Ulam spiral, pyramids, rotating shapes, and polynomial surfaces.  
The sketches are built with the Processing framework and serve both artistic/visual and educational/algorithmic purposes.

## 🎯 Included Sketches  
- `ulam_pyramid.pde` – generates an Ulam spiral in a pyramid-like 3D form.  
- `Pyramid.pde` – renders a pyramid geometry with dynamic visual effects.  
- `Cube.pde` – visualises a rotating cube in 3D space.  
- `Polynome.pde` – draws and animates polynomial-based surface or curve.  
- `Rotate.pde` – simple rotating 2D/3D object demo.  
- `sd.pde` / `sf.pde` – other sketches exploring shapes and number distributions.  
- `Cone.pde`, `ConeSphere.pde` – cone and sphere based visualisations using Processing.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Processing** (Java-based creative coding framework)  
- `.pde` files for sketches  
- 2D and 3D rendering modes  
- Visualisation of mathematics, geometry and number patterns

## ▶️ How to Run the Sketches  
1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org).  
2. Open this repository in Processing (File → Open → select the `.pde` file).  
3. Run the sketch (click the ► Run button).  
4. Explore the visuals, adjust parameters directly in the `.pde` code if desired.

## 🎨 Purpose & Insights  
These sketches aim to:  
- Visualise the Ulam spiral and highlight prime number distribution on a 2D/3D grid.  
- Provide an interactive way to explore geometric and algebraic forms.  
- Serve as a learning tool for algorithmic thinking, creative coding, and visual mathematics.
